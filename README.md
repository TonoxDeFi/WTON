# WTON Fungible Token
This smart contract provides an implementation of wrapped toncoin, called WTON, that allow everyone to convert TON into WTON a single time and then use these same WTON tokens across each dApp.
This token was developed in accordance with the [Fungible Token Standard TIP-74](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TIPs/issues/74).
